# Sulfur Production (Lion053)

Sulfur can be obtained by building Sulfur Modules next to iron, copper, zinc or bauxit mines.
The sulfur module requires coal as an input, increases the required workforce of the mine by 10 % and buffs the mine to produce a sulfur unit after 3 cycles.
The sulfur pit can be built in Enbesa. You will be charged with a debuff if you built too many (>5) sulfur pits per island.
Import with Docklands-DLC possible.
